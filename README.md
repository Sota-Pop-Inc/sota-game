# Sanctuary of the Ancients

## Made by Jed Staley, Evan Cheng, and Wajiha Khan

A 2D dungeon crawler/arcade game similar to Tower of Drauga in which the user must navigate a maze to find a key which will open a door to the next floor. Towards the end, the maze may be autogenerated and there will be enemies and powerups. A score will be kept based on time and progress, and a high score will be recorded. The MVP will be to have a character that moves on screen using the arrow keys which must obtain a key and bring it to the door to succeed.
