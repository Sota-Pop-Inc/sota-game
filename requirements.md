The ultimate goal is to have a 2D dungeon crawler/arcade game that has the character move through a maze.
The character should have to obtain a key and then bring that key to the door in order to progress to the next floor. 
The map should be randomly generated so that each user experience is unique. 
At higher floors, there should be enemies to provide an additional difficulty to the user. 
The user should have a score based on their progress and time per level, which will log as the high score if it is there highest.
